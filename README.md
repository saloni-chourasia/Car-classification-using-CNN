# Car-classification-using-CNN
The goal of this project is to train a machine learning model to classify cars based on their make and model.


The project aims to classify car brands using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The steps involved in the project include data collection and preparation, data preprocessing, defining the CNN architecture, training the model, evaluating its performance using a validation set, and testing the model using a test set.
